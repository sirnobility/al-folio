<p>I'm a university student (Studying EE, minor in Physics/CS) that's interested in a large array of topics (Technology, Metaphysics, Theology, etc,) and thoroughly enjoy learning about them </p>

<p>The underlying motivation behind this website is knowledge acquisition. The idea being, if I research a topic well enough to present it in article form, I will have reached a certain level of understanding of the topic. Naturally, as time goes on, my thoughts and ideas about a subject will change, and I'll update articles accordingly.</p>

<p>The Universe is eminently enigmatic, teeming with potential and the unknown. Every aspect seemingly infinitely complex. It's all so fascinating to me. There are many facets of human knowledge that attempt to understand it at every level, and I'm here to explore and learn about that.</p>

<p>My proclivity is to see things through a theistic perspective, however, I recognize the value of viewing ideas from all angles, so I'll attempt to do so to the best of my ability when the article premise requires it.</p>

<p>Special shout out to Jesus for creating the Universe (John 1:3), and for giving humanity the ultimate gift; Salvation (John 3:16)</p>
