<p>I'm a University student (Studying EE, Minor in Physics/CS) that's interested in a large array of topics, and thoroughly enjoy learning about them. The underlying philosophy behind this website is to understand as much as I possible can about a given topic I'm interested in.</p>

<p>The idea being; if I research a topic well enough to present it in article form I will have reached a level of understanding of the topic. Naturally, as time goes on my thoughts and ideas about a subject will change, and I'll update accordingly.</p>

<p>The Universe is eminently enigmatic. There are many facets of human knowledge that attempt to understand it at every level, and I'm here to explore that a bit.</p>

<p>Special shout out to Jesus for creating the Universe (John 1:3), and for giving humanity the ultimate gift; Salvation (John 3:16)</p>
